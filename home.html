  <h1> Obidience</h1>

  <p> Obidience is one of the most important life skills. In our daily life, we know that obedience is a very essential habit one should abide to in our homes, workplaces and in the communities in which we live. In simple terms, obedience is compliance with an order, request, law or submission to another's authority.Some Kids find Obeying hard, even I do. To prevent disobeying, I take deep breaths and think about wheather God wants you to do, The right thing or the wrong thing.I also think about the consuquenses, are they going to be good consiquences or bad consiquences.</p>

  <br>
<h1> Peer Pressure</h1>
<p> Peer pressure is the direct influence on people by peers, or the effect on an individual who gets encouraged to follow their peers by changing their attitudes, values or behaviors to conform to those of the influencing group or individual. This can result in either a positive or negative effect, or both. I avoid negative peer pressure by calming myself down and think about it, what are the consiquences? Is this the right thing? I can also avaiod negative peer pressure by talking to a grown person like my mum or dad, or even a church pastor, Someone who you are sure is trusted. Negative peer pressure can also come with `bad friends`. That is why it is important to choose `good friends`.</p>
<br>
 <h1> Good habits</h1>
 <p> Good habits shape out who you are, your character, how people know you and think about you. Before you start a habit, think weather its a good habit or a bad habit, because habits are very hard to get out of. I once got into a habit of reading a book when eating, sometimes I got laughed at. Oh!, it was extremely hard to get out of it but somehow I managed to. So, before you atrst a habit, think about it first!</p>
 <br>
 <h1> Kindness</h1>
<p>Kindness is defined as the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate. Affection, gentleness, warmth, concern, and care are words that are associated with kindness.  When you be kind to someone, the reward for your kindness will come one day. Kindness makes you the most beautiful person in the world, no matter what you look like.</p>
<br>
<h1>Relationships</h1>
<p> In healthy relationships, people can feel safe, respected and accepted for who they are. In unhealthy relationships, people may feel anxious, confused, uncertain and even unsafe.Family – your family is not just your parents or carers and your brothers and sisters it is also all your ‘rellies’ [relatives] - like grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. You may or may not live with them; you may get along with them or have massive fights; you may never have met them, or they may be your best friends.Below are some types of relationships:
  <ul>


 <li>Peers - some might be your closest mates; others might be people you don’t like at all.</li>
<li>People at school, or maybe work - you might not want to hang out with them but they are there.</li>
<li>Your best friend - he or she could be your best mate, or sometimes the person who gets to you most!</li>
<li>Your neighbour, your doctor, your postie, your sports coach - you might meet regularly or never meet – we all have a relationship with others in our community.</li>
<li>People in your interest groups - sports teams, music, drama, art or youth groups. You all share an interest but that doesn’t mean you will be “Besties”</li></ul>
 <br>
 Here are some things for healthy relationships:
<ul>


<li>Respect - no put-downs, each of you having the right to have an opinion, to be listened to, and being able to voice what you think and feel.</li>
<li>Trust – neither of you would gossip about the other and you don’t tell lies to or about each other.</li>
<li>Safety - feeling safe from physical, emotional or other forms of harm.</li>
<li>Equality - look out for power in relationships and who holds it – feeling powerless or more powerful than another person can affect your health and theirs.</li>
<li>Consistency - you know where you and others stand.</li>
<li>Value - you feel valued and you value the other person.</li>
<li>Security and loyalty - you feel safe that both parties value the relationship.</li>
<li>Empathy - listening and understanding each other - putting yourself in the other person’s shoes.</li>
<li>Genuineness – it is a human, natural and honest relationship.</li>
</ul>
